- xarray
- matplotlib
- cartopy

You can typically install these packages using `pip`:

pip install xarray matplotlib cartopy

## Functionality

The script performs the following key tasks:

    - Imports necessary Python libraries and modules.

    - Defines functions for setting up map projections and formatting map features.

    - Loads climate data files from the specified directory using glob.

    - Creates subplots for displaying climate data maps.

    - Generates maps of climate data for the MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR model under the RCP 2.6 scenario.

    - Adds titles, labels, and colorbars to the visualizations.

## Important Note

This script is tailored to a specific function and purpose of the authors preference. If you are working with different idea, data or models, you may need to adapt the script accordingly.
